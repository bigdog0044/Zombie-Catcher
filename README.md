# Zombie-Catcher
<h1> Overview </h1>
At university, I developed a program named ZombieCatcher to help restaurants, cafes, and other venues on campus slow down the potential outbreak of a zombie apocalypse in Egham!

The way in which this program works is the user will first enter a time period where a zombie was known to be on the premises. A time period will be represented by two integers – a start and an end time. For example a start of 5 and end of 7 means the zombie was on the premises from 5 o’ clock to 7 o’ clock. We will only count whole hours for this exercise.

After entering this time period, the user then enters the names of all visitors and the time they were on site. The program will print out if each visitor needs to be quarantined, and summarise at the end how many potential new zombies have been identified.
